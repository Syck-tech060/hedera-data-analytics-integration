# Hedera Data Analytics Integration
### 🚀 Bridging Traditional Data Systems with Hedera DLT

This project demonstrates how Hedera’s Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) can enhance traditional data analytics pipelines by introducing immutability, tokenization, and automation.

---

## 🧩 Features
- **Immutable Data Logging (HCS):** Every CSV or SQL batch is hashed and logged for auditability.  
- **Tokenized Data Access (HTS):** Access rights are represented as fungible tokens (“DAT”).  
- **Automated Compliance (HSCS):** Smart contracts handle anomaly reports and audit triggers.

## ⚙️ Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Syck-tech060/hedera-data-analytics-integration
